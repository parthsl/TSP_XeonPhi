# TSP_XeonPhi
Various Techniques to optimize TSP on Xeon Phi Host Machines and also for comparing various related algortihms.

The repo is divied in two paths:
- Sequential : Contains sequential codes for each algorithms.
- Parallel   : Should contain OpenMP and/or MPICH version of the sequential codes.

Each folder contains makefile to compile and clean the codes. 

TSPLIB is used to verify algorithms in here. <a href="https://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/groups/comopt/software/TSPLIB95/STSP.html">TSPLIB Optimal Values</a>
